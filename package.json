  "description": "This repo includes the baseline Terraform/Atmos and Javascript files necessary to spool up an AWS Lambda function running Node.js 16.x.  The intent is to provide a pre-built foundation so you can focus on creating the the parts of your application that are unique to the custom integration rather than the AWS infrastructure and config.  These instructions assume you've completed Drift Engineering onboarding steps that include AWS setup and installing the Drift CLI.",
